# Developing Secure Software in 2024

## Abstract

As humanity increases its dependence on computer systems, the need for safe and secure software becomes paramount. Today, everything from planes, trains, and automobiles to toothbrushes and cooktops contain a multitude of tiny computers. Each of these systems, in turn, contain software written to tell these computers how to do their jobs and connect them with other computers. Security problems in these systems, while context dependent, have led to consequences ranging from minor annoyance to loss of human life.

During this presentation, the speaker will discuss problems that erode our trust in computers and propose solutions that can lead to a better future. Trust suffers due to problems that arise from within both the software development and computer security industries. If humanity hopes to achieve a better future, we will need to learn from our collective mistakes and invest in not repeating them. Luckily, modern tools and techniques can help us get there. Just a few key shifts in our approach can make a world of difference.
