## Motivations

1. Improve global security maximally through computer science and engineering.
2. Raise awareness to build cross-industry momentum.


## Disclaimer

I feel vastly underqualified to cover this topic. I am simply doing my
best to present the facts and share my experiences.


## A word on Trust and Guarantees

- Trust: TODO
- Guarantees: TODO

# History Lession
<div class="ctitle-line"></div>

## How did we get here?


# My personal journey

* Programming since age 11
* Internet user since age 13
* Studied Math + CS in university
* Learned C programming in 1997


# Undefined Bevahior

- Intentional ambiguity in language specification

TODO


# UB: Consequence

Often times memory corruption and loss of integrity

## What just happened / is happening?



# Ongoing I - CHERI

<div class="footnote">
1. <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/ctsrd/cheri/">https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/ctsrd/cheri/</a><br />
2. <a href="https://www.morello-project.org/">https://www.morello-project.org/</a>
</div>

Capability Hardware Enhanced RISC Instructions (CHERI)
 - "joint research project of SRI International and the University of Cambridge to revisit fundamental design choices in hardware and software to dramatically improve system security"

Capabilities are bounded pointers / cannot be forged

Expect silicon in fall 2024 (fingers crossed)

For now: Morello project

CHERI represents a paradigm shift in computing

# Ongoing II - OpenSSF

<div class="footnote">1. <a href="https://openssf.org/">https://openssf.org/</a></div>

Open Source Security Foundation
 - "seeks to make it easier to sustainably secure the development, maintenance, and consumption of the open source software (OSS) we all depend on."

Funded by the Linux Foundation


# Ongoing III - Defining Undefined Behavior

- TODO: Intel guy work (emailed him, no response)


# TODO - more slides
